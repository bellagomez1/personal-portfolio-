# Personal Portfolio — Prototype

This is a small, responsive, and accessible static prototype for a personal portfolio.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — styles
- `images/profile.svg` — simple profile illustration

How to view locally

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click the file) OR run a local server (recommended):

```zsh
cd ~/Documents/My\ website
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

How to test responsiveness

- In a browser, open DevTools (Cmd+Option+I) and toggle device toolbar (Cmd+Shift+M) to simulate phones.

Next steps (we can do next)
- Replace placeholder text and add real projects
- Add a contact form or mailto link
- Improve visual design or add images/screenshots
- Deploy to a hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)
